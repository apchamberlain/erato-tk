[Sieve of Eratosthenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)
demo in Tcl/Tk.  Run at the command line with the length of one side
of the square of numbers you want to find primes in as the only
parameter.  (i.e. 10 for a 100-cell square, etc.)  Should work fine on
Linux or OS X installs, since they usually have the `wish` executable
in the normal place.  On Windows you may have to run this from inside
a GUI environment such as ActiveState Tcl.
